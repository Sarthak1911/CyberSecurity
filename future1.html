                        You can’t discuss the future of cybersecurity without considering emerging trends in technology and threat landscapes. As organizations develop and adopt technologies related to big data, cognitive computing and the Internet of Things (IOT), cyberthreats are growing in both volume and complexity.
					</p>
					<p>
						The race is on to secure these systems and devices before fraudsters figure out how to exploit them. Let’s take a look at some of the most important themes and innovations shaping our increasingly interconnected world.                        
                    </p>
					<p>
						Whether or not Chris Roberts, the security researcher who recently claimed to have hacked into the flight control system of a plane while it was in flight, was telling the truth about his ability to hijack a plane, we've most definitely entered the era of cybercrime.
					</p>
					<p>
						The idea that a criminal group could electronically take control of a plane — or flight control system or power grid — is feasible.
					</p>
					<p>
						As everything connects to the internet we become more and more vulnerable to cybercrime. In February, the world found out that the Carbanak criminal organization had stolen up to $1 billion from banks around the world over the past two years, hacking into their systems, transferring money out, and having bank ATMs automatically dispense cash that they then picked up from the machines. These cyber-robberies are still going on, according to the security experts at Kaspersky lab.

                    <h1>About the future of Cyber Security by experts:</h1>
					<h3>Ondrej Vlcek, CTO & GM of Consumer at Avast</h3>
                    <p>
                        “In 10-15 years, we will be deep in a ‘war of the machines’ era with advances in artificial intelligence bringing fast and sophisticated execution of security defense and cybercrime. This will be a battle of AI vs AI.</br>
						The availability of low cost computing and storage, off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms, AI code and open AI platforms will drive increased AI use by the good guys to defend and protect – but also increase deployment of AI by the bad guys. There will be sophisticated attacks launched on a grand scale, quickly and intelligently with little human intervention, that compromise our digital devices and web infrastructure.</br>
						Cybercriminals will create fully autonomous, AI-based attacks that will operate completely independently, adapt, make decisions on their own and more. Security companies will counter this by developing and deploying AI-based defensive systems. Humans will simply supervise the process.”
                         
                    </p>
					<h3>Adnan Amjad, Partner at Deloitte</h3>
                    <p>
                        “Employers will look further outside of IT for tech talent. Organizations aren’t just looking for the standard computer engineer anymore.</br>
						While they still need the engineers, the developers, data scientists and the technological tools to write, pull and track data, the need to have professionals who can make sense of all of that data and communicate it back to the executive team in business terms that they can understand is becoming increasingly important.</br>
						How someone is able to present technical information and frame it as a business problem is going to be in high demand. We will see more organizations looking outside the traditional skill set to cultivate the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.”

                         
                    </p>
					<h3>Daniel Miessler, Directory of Advisory Services atIOActive</h3>
                    <p>
                        “A big trend I see is a focus on service resilience, i.e., making it so that a DDoS can melt one provider or one datacenter, but your service will automatically migrate to another site that can serve the same content.</br>
						Expect resilience, as opposed to prevention, will become more talked about.”
					</p>
					<h3>John Bambenek, Threat Systems Manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity</h3>
                    <p>
						“We can expect the unexpected. I never would have predicted last year that we would be talking about the DNC and hacking of elections.</br>
						Expect new trends to come out of left field. Ransomware will be on the upswing and evolve in new unforeseen ways. It will be more targeted and focus on more valuable targets as we saw with healthcare. And it will continue to attack new, more damaging industries like we recently witnessed with San Francisco BART and Muni.</br>
						Like the attacks with Krebs and Dyn, DDoS is coming back in a big way. Thanks to the proliferation of insecure things on the Internet, the risk of crippling cyberattacks will only increase.”
					</p>
					<h3>Konstantinos Karagianni, CTO of BT</h3>
                    <p>
                        “Blockchains are moving from the realm of just fueling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to providing smart contracts, identity management, and multiple ways of proving integrity of data. They may also hold the key to defending against IoT attacks.</br>
						Quantum computing will have possibly the biggest impact within 10 years. Most over-the-wire encrypted transmissions collected over the next decade will be readable, and even private keys will be reversible from public blockchains (for example, you can spend someone else’s Bitcoin). Post-quantum safe crypto will be a must.</br>
						AI will be used to identify hacking flaws and patch them to stay ahead of malicious attackers.”
					</p>
					<h3>Carl Herberger, VP of security at Radware</h3>
                    <p>
						“The top challenge for cybersecurity isn’t preventing data breaches, stamping out ransomware, or preventing ever-more-massive DDoS attacks, it is securing our digital privacy. 2017 and the years to come will dictate the future of cybersecurity, and most importantly human privacy. Digital threats have evolved quickly and can wreak havoc on our lives, endangering our personal privacy and the privacy of those around us.</br>
						To tackle this important issue, we need the national government to take a stance on what our digital privacy is. Is it an immutable human right? If so, there needs to be explicit legislation that goes beyond what is currently in place. It needs to protect each and every citizen and hold those who might put our privacy in jeopardy accountable for their actions. This will be the most important cybersecurity decision in the next year and it will shape the security landscape for years to come.”
					</p>
					<h3>Brandon Ackroyd, Founder of TigerMobile</h3>
                    <p>
                        “The future that I see is Universal Second Factor Authentication as standard on all logins that contain sensitive information. U2F is similar to Two Factor authentication (2FA) but more secure.</br>
						Whilst 2FA is better than nothing, it is inherently insecure. The most popular methods like Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP), used by offerings like Google Auth services, transmit a shared secret master key) over the internet during the setup process.</br>
						This weakness is now being recognised more than ever with companies like Dropbox partnering with Intel on U2F after their hacking issues last year. Universal Second Factor (U2F) outperforms 2FA because it never reveals sensitive information.
					</p>
					<h3>Ziv Levi, Co-founder & CEO of Arilou</h3>
                    <p>
                        “There will be a shift in the basic human feelings of security as crime becomes more focused on the cyber domain. New threat models will arise, and cyber criminals will get their inspiration from the IT world (ransomware, APTs, and more).</br>
						One major target area will be vehicles. With every car now connected, each one is a potential target. Vehicles are controlled by Electronic Control Units (ECU), and cyber security will become an integrated part of every ECU, just as security is embedded in any PC or organizational network. Consumers will see it as standard just like seat belts, ABS, and other automotive safety elements.</br>
						This will also change whole industries. For example, insurance models will shift from covering the decreasing number of car accidents, and instead focus on data breaches and accidents that are a result of bugs or hacks.”

                        Massive amounts of data are produced by a rapidly growing number of devices. The equation is very simple: More devices means more data, both structured and unstructured.
					</p>
					<p>
						Widespread mobile adoption has led to the rise of social networks, which generate even more data. Unsurprisingly, data scientists have developed ways to leverage this information in advertising and marketing campaigns. But what happens if cybercriminals get their hands on this data? With such power to influence the public’s behavior, the consequences could be dire.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Even the human brain itself can produce data for researchers to analyze. Scientists use sensors to understand how the brain reacts to certain stimulants and emotions in the interest of medical advancement. Needless to say, the data produced by these experiments is highly valuable to researchers and malicious actors alike.
					</p>
					<p>
					But while big data certainly represents a juicy target for fraudsters, it can also help security professionals fight cyberthreats. In the cyber world, criminal activity always leaves a digital trail. Security analysts can use this data to predict attacks and identify malicious actors before they strike. The process of analyzing millions of unstructured records, however, can take days.
					</p>
					<p>
					That’s where cognitive security comes in. With machine learning, IT professionals can process threat data more efficiently, and more accurately predict criminal activity. This is just one of the many ways in which cognitive computing will shape the future of cybersecurity.
					</p>
					<p>
					While many institutions and government agencies have implemented regulations to protect data, the increasingly sophisticated threat landscape demands a sweeping culture change when it comes to security. Users should be careful not to publish sensitive information on social media and adopt fundamental security solutions such as password protection, firewalls and antivirus software. Enterprises must implement security controls and train employees to use them.
